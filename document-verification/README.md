### Smart Contracts Used for Document Verification

The second implementation I will be considering is the use of smart contracts for document verification. A number of systems for this have already been proposed, so I will attempt to create a simple example of such, while analysing how it can be used in the local context.

#### Assumptions
1. That methods for identity verification are available, and accepted legally.
