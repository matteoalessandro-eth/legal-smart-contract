### Legal Implementations of Smart Contracts

This repo will be used to experiment with a number of practical implementations for smart contracts. They will form part of a series of articles which attempt the translation of legal clauses into code. 

For most cases, I will first start with a pseudo-code version, and then attempt to develop this into a Solidity smart contract.

I will be making use of a number of open sources, and pre-made contracts, with thanks to the respective authors.
