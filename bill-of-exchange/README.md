### Smart Contracts used for Bills of Exchange

The first implementation which will be considered is the use of smart contracts to create bills of exchange. These will be analysed in the local (Maltese) context, and then a basic implementation of them is proposed. 

#### Assumptions
1. That tokens are construed as 'containers' which can hold rights, as was implemented by the Liechtenstein TVTG Act and as proposed by myself in a forthcoming paper.

2. That methods for identity verification are available, and accepted legally.
